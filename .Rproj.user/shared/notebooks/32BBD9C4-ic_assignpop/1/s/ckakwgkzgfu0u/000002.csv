"0","#Reduce low variance within our dataset and create a new matrix for it. The ""p"" value is set to 0.95, meaning that a locus will be removed from the dataset if its major allele occurs in over 95% of individuals across the populations. This will leave only the data with higher variance, which will make our results more interesting."
